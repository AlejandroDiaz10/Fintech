    " # 📌 Objectives\n",
    " \n",
    " By the end of this notebook, students will be able to:\n",
    " \n",
    " 1. **Load and Explore Financial News Data:**\n",
    "    - Load a preprocessed dataset of financial news headlines and summaries related to S&P 500 companies.\n",
    "    - Inspect and structure relevant metadata including publication date, ticker, and provider.\n",
    " \n",
    " 2. **Build a Custom Vector Store:**\n",
    "    - Combine title and summary text for embedding.\n",
    "    - Implement a vector store from scratch with support for semantic search and optional metadata-based filtering using cosine similarity.\n",
    " \n",
    " 3. **Generate and Use Sentence Embeddings:**\n",
    "    - Apply a pre-trained transformer model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) to encode text into embeddings for semantic analysis.\n",
    " \n",
    " 4. **Perform Semantic Search with Filtering:**\n",
    "    - Retrieve the most relevant news documents for a given query using both full-dataset and metadata-filtered searches.\n",
    " \n",
    " 5. **Analyze Semantic Search Results:**\n",
    "    - Interpret and visualize results of search queries (e.g., \"AI announcement\").\n",
    "    - Identify temporal patterns and ticker frequency among top-ranked results.\n",
    " \n",
    " 6. **Implement a FAISS-Based Vector Store:**\n",
    "    - Normalize embeddings and use FAISS (IndexFlatIP) to enable efficient similarity search at scale.\n",
    "    - Compare FAISS-based search results with custom vector store results.\n",
    " \n",
    " 7. **Critically Compare Search Systems:**\n",
    "    - Evaluate differences in similarity computation, speed, and scalability between custom and FAISS-based systems.\n",
    "    - Reflect on design trade-offs for real-world vector search systems."

    "**RESPONSE:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The histogram clearly shows that AI-related news articles are heavily clustered in recent months, rather than being evenly distributed over time. Specifically, May 2025 accounts for the overwhelming majority of the top 50 most semantically relevant documents retrieved using the query \"AI announcement\".\n",
    "\n",
    "This concentration suggests that AI has recently emerged as a dominant theme in financial news and corporate communication. The absence of a more uniform distribution indicates that AI-related narratives are not consistently present across months but instead tend to surge in waves, likely triggered by external factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several plausible explanations may account for the observed spike in AI announcements:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Earnings Season and Strategic Positioning**: May often coincides with Q1 earnings calls, where companies highlight strategic initiatives. Given the current momentum in AI, many firms may have chosen this window to emphasize AI-related investments to attract investor attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Technological Milestones**: Recent breakthroughs or product releases (such as new generative AI capabilities) may have prompted a surge of press releases and news coverage as firms seek to align themselves with industry trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Market Sentiment and Competitive Signaling**: Companies may also be reacting to peer behavior or market expectations. In a competitive landscape, highlighting AI initiatives can be seen as a signal of innovation and forward-thinking, especially in tech-adjacent sectors."

    "Upon reviewing the top-5 results for each query retrieved using both the CustomVectorStore and the FaissVectorStore, we observe that the results are identical in both content and ranking order across all six queries. For each query, the same news articles are retrieved with the same cosine similarity scores and metadata (e.g., TICKER, publication date, provider).\n",

    "This consistency can be explained by the fact that both systems rely on the same underlying sentence-transformer model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) to generate text embeddings and use cosine similarity as the distance metric. The only architectural difference lies in the retrieval backend:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* The FaissVectorStore uses FAISS with IndexFlatIP on pre-normalized vectors to approximate cosine similarity efficiently.\n",

This is further reinforced by the normalized vectors, which guarantee that the inner product precisely reflects cosine similarity."

    "Vector normalization plays a fundamental role in both the CustomVectorStore and the FaissVectorStore, as it ensures that similarity computations truly reflect the semantic closeness between text representations. Since both systems rely on cosine similarity as the underlying metric, normalization is essential to ensure that the comparison is based on direction rather than magnitude of the vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the CustomVectorStore, vector normalization is handled implicitly by the cosine_similarity function from scikit-learn. This function internally normalizes the vectors to unit length before computing the cosine of the angle between them. As a result, the implementation remains simple and correct without requiring explicit preprocessing of the vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, the FaissVectorStore uses FAISS’s IndexFlatIP, which performs inner product computations. To use this as a proxy for cosine similarity, vectors must be explicitly normalized prior to insertion into the index. This is because, for unit-normalized vectors, the inner product becomes equivalent to cosine similarity. Without this normalization, FAISS would measure raw vector magnitudes in addition to directional similarity, which would bias the ranking toward longer or denser embeddings rather than those that are semantically closest to the query."

    "If vectors are not normalized before indexing, the retrieval results (particularly in systems like FaissVectorStore that rely on inner product, aka \"dot product\", similarity) would be mathematically incorrect and semantically misleading.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of IndexFlatIP, which computes the inner product between query and document vectors, omitting normalization means that vector magnitude directly influences the similarity score. This undermines the core assumption of cosine similarity, which evaluates semantic similarity based solely on the direction of vectors in the embedding space, not their length.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, longer vectors (i.e., those with larger L2 norms) would receive artificially inflated similarity scores, regardless of whether they are semantically close to the query. This can lead to several critical issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Irrelevant documents may be ranked higher simply because their embeddings have greater magnitude, not because they are contextually related to the query.\n",
    "* Truly relevant documents may be overlooked, as their shorter vectors yield lower inner product scores, despite being directionally aligned with the query vector.\n",
    "* The overall retrieval behavior becomes unstable and inconsistent, particularly across queries of varying length or specificity.\n",

    "For a production-scale semantic search system, the FaissVectorStore implementation is clearly the preferred choice. While both the CustomVectorStore and FaissVectorStore provide functionally equivalent results in small to medium-scale scenarios, the FAISS-based approach offers several critical advantages that make it far more suitable for large-scale deployments.\n",
    "\n",
    "First and foremost, FAISS is specifically designed for high-performance vector similarity search at scale. It supports efficient indexing, optimized low-level operations (in C++/CUDA), and can handle millions of high-dimensional vectors with superior speed and memory efficiency. This makes it highly suitable for real-time applications such as search engines, recommendation systems, and AI-driven financial platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, the CustomVectorStore relies on in-memory Python operations and scikit-learn’s pairwise similarity functions, which are computationally intensive and do not scale well beyond a few thousand documents. As dataset size grows, response latency increases significantly, making it impractical for low-latency or high-throughput environments.\n",

    "Furthermore, the FAISS implementation can be extended to use approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) techniques, such as IVF, HNSW, or PQ, which offer trade-offs between accuracy and speed, essential for optimizing user experience at scale. It also integrates well with GPU acceleration, further reducing latency in production environments.\n",
