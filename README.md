# Fintech and Digital Innovation in Finance

This repository contains projects developed as part of the course **Fintech and Digital Innovation in Finance**, focused on the application of modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to financial data and systems. Each module explores a different aspect of AI-driven innovation in finance through hands-on projects.

## Course Modules and Projects

### Module 1: Foundations of NLP  
**Topic:** Text embeddings and transformer models in financial applications  
**Project:** Implementation of transformer-based embeddings to analyze and process financial texts such as earnings reports, news articles, or regulatory filings.

### Module 2: Semantic Search and Vector Database Techniques  
**Topic:** Vector databases and similarity-based retrieval  
**Project:** Build a semantic search engine for financial documents using vector representations and a vector database (e.g., FAISS or Weaviate).

### Module 3: Advanced AI Techniques  
**Topic:** Foundation models, large language models (LLMs), and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)  
**Project:** Design a RAG pipeline that leverages LLMs and structured retrieval for answering finance-specific queries.

### Module 4: Advanced Natural Language Processing  
**Topic:** Inference, sentiment analysis, and enhanced RAG techniques  
**Project:** Develop a sentiment analysis system for financial text with integrated inference capabilities and RAG optimization.
