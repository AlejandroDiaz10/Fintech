    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, students will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Perform Semantic Search with Metadata Filtering:**\n",
    "   - Query the provided FAISS vector store to retrieve relevant financial news articles based on natural language questions.\n",
    "   - Apply optional filters using metadata such as ticker or publication date to refine search results.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Enrich Data with Company Metadata:**\n",
    "   - Use the `yfinance` library to retrieve company-level metadata (company name, sector, industry) for tickers in the dataset.\n",
    "   - Integrate this metadata to support enhanced filtering and analysis of news data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline:**\n",
    "   - Combine retrieved news snippets as context to generate answers using OpenAI’s GPT models.\n",
    "   - Construct effective prompts that guide the language model to provide concise, context-aware responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Evaluate and Analyze RAG Outputs:**\n",
    "   - Review generated answers alongside the supporting news excerpts.\n",
    "   - Reflect on the strengths and limitations of the simple RAG pipeline and consider potential improvements, such as adding more filters or refining retrieval strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Incorporate Financial Metadata into Retrieval Context:**\n",
    "   - Enrich retrieved news snippets with key financial metadata including ticker, company name, sector, and industry.\n",
    "   - Format prompts that combine both text excerpts and metadata to provide richer context to the language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Generate Context-Aware Answers Using OpenAI Models:**\n",
    "   - Construct and send prompts to an LLM that leverage both news content and metadata to produce concise, informed financial analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Compare Answers With and Without Metadata:**\n",
    "   - Evaluate the impact of including financial metadata on answer quality using criteria such as clarity, detail, accuracy, and contextual relevance.\n",
    "   - Summarize findings to reflect on the role of metadata in improving retrieval-augmented generation."

    "**RESPONSE:**\n",
    "\n",
    "For most of the questions, the retrieved news snippets provide a solid foundation for the generated answers, with key facts and themes traceable to the contextual excerpts. In the inflation question, for instance, the answer’s focus on persistent U.S. inflation risks, the Federal Reserve’s concerns, and the impact of food inflation is clearly grounded in multiple snippets referencing Fed minutes and tariff-related pressures. Similarly, the AI in finance response directly aligns with retrieved articles on Jack Henry, Palantir, Upstart, and Meta, reinforcing the connection between the stated themes and the source material.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are cases where grounding is weaker. For example, in the Microsoft AI question, the retrieved context did not contain any Microsoft-specific snippets, leading to a correct model disclaimer about insufficient information. This indicates that retrieval precision can vary, and when relevant documents are missing, the generated content cannot be meaningfully anchored to the context. In general, when relevant matches are present, the answers remain well-supported and faithful to the retrieved material, but performance depends heavily on retrieval accuracy and coverage for the given query."

   "source": [
    "**RESPONSE:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases, the answers adequately address the main intent of the questions, but, once again, the level of completeness varies depending on the richness of the retrieved context. For the inflation and AI in finance topics, the context contained multiple, diverse snippets covering different angles of the issue—policy concerns, economic impacts, and company-level applications—which allowed the model to produce comprehensive, multi-faceted responses. These answers not only reflected the central themes but also incorporated secondary details that added depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, some answers reveal clear gaps tied to retrieval limitations. The Microsoft AI question is a prime example: the absence of any Microsoft-related articles in the retrieved set meant that the model could not elaborate on the company’s portrayal and instead provided a non-answer. Similarly, certain industry-level questions, such as those on the semiconductor and retail sectors, offered relevant but somewhat narrow perspectives, omitting potential macroeconomic or competitive dynamics that might have been captured with broader retrieval. Overall, completeness is strong when retrieval returns diverse, directly relevant sources, but noticeably constrained when the context set is limited or too homogeneous."

    "Yes, there are instances where irrelevant or tangential snippets appear in the retrieved context, which can subtly dilute the precision of the generated answers. For example, in the Amazon automation/logistics question, some retrieved articles referenced broader industry players or unrelated companies (e.g., Woodward or C.H. Robinson) without a direct link to Amazon’s automation strategy. While these may provide peripheral industry context, they risk shifting the model’s focus away from the target entity and introducing speculative connections, as seen when the answer loosely associated logistics sector trends with Amazon’s operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, in a few industry-level queries, certain snippets addressed companies or events only indirectly tied to the question’s scope. Although the model often filters out clearly irrelevant details, the presence of loosely related material increases the chance of subtle bias (where the generated text emphasizes secondary themes or overgeneralizes trends not strongly supported by the question’s intent). This underscores the importance of refining retrieval filters (e.g., by ticker, sector, or keyword constraints) to ensure that the context remains tightly aligned with the query, thereby enhancing factual grounding and minimizing noise in the output."

    "Overall, the retrieved news snippets tend to present consistent information within each query’s scope, with minimal direct contradictions. For example, in the inflation and AI in finance questions, the excerpts largely reinforce one another (multiple sources echo concerns about persistent inflationary pressures or highlight the strategic role of AI in specific companies) allowing the model to synthesize a coherent narrative without reconciling opposing claims.\n",

    "In cases where slight variations in emphasis occur (such as differing levels of optimism in investor sentiment headlines or varying degrees of risk in energy industry coverage) the model appears to smooth these differences into a balanced response. It typically blends perspectives, acknowledging both positive and negative elements rather than explicitly flagging disagreement. This approach maintains a unified tone but can obscure the existence of genuine divergences in viewpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the absence of sharp contradictions simplifies generation, it also means the LLM has limited opportunity to demonstrate conflict resolution or source attribution skills.

    "| **Clarity**              | The answers are generally clear but lack specific company context, making them less precise.                                                                                                                                 | The answers are highly clear, as they directly tie information to specific companies, sectors, and industries.                                                                                 |\n",
    "| **Detail & Depth**       | Provides a broad, generalized summary of financial trends, often citing news without linking it to specific entities. The depth is limited to the provided news snippets.                                                    | Offers a richer, more detailed answer by explicitly mentioning companies (e.g., BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, Microsoft) and their respective sectors, providing a more granular view.             |\n",
    "| **Use of Context**       | The model struggles with company-specific questions (like Microsoft), returning a \"lack of information\" response because its retrieval mechanism isn't explicitly tied to tickers.                                           | The model effectively uses the enriched context. For example, it correctly identifies Microsoft's partnerships and Amazon's AI investments, directly answering the questions.                  |\n",
    "| **Accuracy & Grounding** | Answers are accurate relative to the retrieved snippets, but can be misleading due to the lack of specific entity-based grounding. For example, it might mention a trend without identifying which companies are driving it. | The answers are highly grounded and accurate. By including metadata, the model can explicitly reference companies and their roles, making the information more verifiable and reliable.        |\n",
    "| **Relevance**            | The answers are relevant to the general topic but may not be the most precise. For example, for the Amazon question, the answer is a little generic and pulls in irrelevant context.                                         | The answers are highly relevant and focused. The metadata ensures that the retrieved context is more specific to the query, leading to a more targeted response.                               |\n",
    "| **Narrative Flow**       | The text often reads as a collection of loosely connected facts, as it combines snippets from various companies and topics without a unifying thread.                                                                        | The narrative flows more cohesively. The inclusion of company names and sectors allows the model to build a more logical and structured narrative that directly addresses the user's question. |\n",

    "This evaluation clearly demonstrates that enriching a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline with structured financial metadata (such as company name, ticker symbol, sector, and industry) yields substantial performance gains across all key evaluation dimensions. Compared to the baseline semantic similarity approach, the metadata-enhanced pipeline consistently delivers answers that are clearer, more accurate, and better grounded in verifiable context, while also maintaining a coherent narrative structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strategic integration of metadata acts as a contextual anchor for the Large Language Model (LLM), reducing ambiguity and ensuring that generated outputs remain closely tied to relevant entities and their roles. This not only mitigates the risk of vague or misleading responses but also enhances trustworthiness, an essential requirement in high-stakes domains like finance.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a broader perspective, this approach exemplifies the principles of context engineering: the deliberate structuring and enrichment of information to optimize LLM performance. Its scalability and domain-agnostic nature make it a viable strategy for other sectors where entity-level metadata is available, paving the way for more precise, reliable, and explainable AI systems."
